Program: DarkTree version 1.0

Released by: Rodrigo Capucha, Karim Elyaouti, Margarete MÃ¼hlleitner, Johann Plotnikov, Rui SantosManual: version 2.0


#### TODO
DarkTree: The C++ program DarkTree is a tool to efficiently search parameter spaces of extension of the Standard Model. 
calculates the dark matter relic density in extensions of the Standard Model. For this the annihillation amplitudes, cross sections and thermal average cross sections are calculated and the boltzmann equation is solved. 
########



The models implemented so far are

    CP in the Dark (arXiv 1807.10322, arXiv 2204.13425)
    Complex Singlet Extension (CxSM)

The code is structured such that users can add their own models.
